## Goal
The goal here is to create a software or app can will assist in writing campaigns/one-shots for Dungeons & Dragons. Creating homebrew (entirely made on your own) campaigns is pretty challenging- you as the Dungeon Master (DM) are responsible for entertaining a group of players, making them care about what happens to their characters, creating an interesting plothook, and making sure the conflict and resolution are satisfying. Maintaining a story structure like this whilst seamlessly implementing encounters, characters and quests with the same level of emersion is very tricky. Which is why this software will be built to build all of that, when needed, at the touch of a button with only a few words necessary beforehand. 

## Premise 
Say you're writing up a new set of encounters for a location that your players will enter. You're getting writer's block, and none of your ideas seem good enough to proceed with. You're sure you want an encounter with an NPC, but aren't sure what the NPC will want (because you just came up with all this for a group of NPC's in the last town your players encountered and this process took the rest of your creative energy). So you turn on the software and type "players arrive in **[location]**... and the sofware will auto-insert a random name from a repository full of location names. If you want location names that sound particularly Dwarven, Elven or Infernal, just type **[location Dwarven]** and the software will insert a random name from a list of Dwarven themed location names. Similar inserts will exist for **[name]**, **[name male]**, **[name elven female]** and so on. 

## How
I'll create a bunch of repositories, or dictionaries in Python. Each will be titled something like "name dwarven", and it'll have ideally hundreds of named associated with that class or style. Once it gets bigger, I can make names more specific to a region in the given world, or DMs can plug in names of their own. Similar dictionaries will exist for "encounter" and "hook" or "monster".
